For last few months, my thoughts are like cluttered. Since my father's cancer treatment has started, I am overthinking about everything. Every small matter is creating anxiety in me.

It is not new for me to have water problems in the building since I started staying in Hyderabad since 15 years. But this year, the panic and anxiety it caused is very much. Same with the India Pakistan war situation happened. I know I cannot do anything in the war situation. But I kept refreshing and scrolling Twitter for latest news and updates. 

After my father's cancer diagnosis, I went into complete panic and war mode within myslef. I feel a strong need to be in control of things and be prepared for the situations that might or might not arise. It helped in a way to effectively tackle the first wave of treatment for my father. But it created more damage than good. 

My family is looking up to me to make all big decisions about my father's treatment. It is a matter of his life and death. I have seen my father as a lion, a person who can tackle anything. Now I am seeing him in a weak state trying to cope up with the treatments, pain and uncertainity. I don't know how to console him. I am acting in front of them to be strong. The day Saba and I cried holding each other in arms is the real me. I am tired mentally, financially taking all the decisions, driving things. I want to take a back seat for a while. I want to lead life where I don't have to take life altering decisions at-least for a while. 

The fears in my mind are not about the water or anything. It is the fear of me not able to handle things and trying to be incharge of things. It is causing anxiety in me. I pray to Allah daily to make things better, to help me lead a happy and peaceful life. I hope He grants me it soon.

Till then, To take on each fight as it arises.........
